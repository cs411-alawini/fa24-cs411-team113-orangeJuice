## Project Summary

Our project aims to offer a centralized platform to compare university and higher education institutions based on factors such as admission statistics and research output. This application will allow prospective students to create rankings of several higher education institutions based on their desired qualities. Users will be able to see the relative rankings of these institutions based on data, which can allow them to make more informed decisions. Students will be able to create accounts and mark their favorite institutions, and rank these institutions later on. This personalized feature allows students to keep track of schools they are interested in and rank them based on their evolving preferences. Ultimately, the platform will serve as a comprehensive tool for students to explore, compare, and choose universities that best align with their academic goals and personal priorities.
